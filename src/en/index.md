The CIDOC CRM Japanese Translation Group aims to translate and support the utilization of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM). For more information on the CIDOC CRM, please visit [CIDOC CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/). This translation project is part of the [Construction of Japanese Historical Knowledge and Open Science Research](https://www.metaresource.jp/) project led by the National Museum of Japanese History. Since May 2021, it has been working to establish a foundation to make knowledge of Japan's historical and cultural heritage internationally accessible and understandable.
